<h2>Tips</h2>
<!-- TODO &y2013.02.01.10:28:23& only show this text if a player is a follower of this constitution -->
If you are a follower of this constitution, please read the following important tips:
<ul>
   <li>Look at the score of the latest release of this constitution (that's the one with the highest number in the column "release"). Has it improved, compared to the previous releases? Or did it get worse? Do you have any ideas for how to improve it for the next release?</li>
   <li>Is there a release before this one which clearly better than the latest release? What are the differences? Consider reintroducing some of the things which were changed compared to the older, but better release.</li>
   <li>Try to investigate what the effect of the contributions you made to a specific release are. Do this by looking to which releases you made a contribution, by searching for occurrences of your name in the list of publications prior to a specific release, but after another.</li>
   <li>Also click on your names in the list to see the contributions you did make (and the publication just before it). For example, if you made minor changes, than your impact will probably not have been so great.</li>
   <li>Click on contributions made by other players, and see of you agree with them. If you don't, you can role back the changes, OR you can start a new constitution ("branch off").</li>
</ul>
